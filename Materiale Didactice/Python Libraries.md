# Python Libraries

- **Scapy**
    - **Installation Command**: pip install scapy
    - **Advantages**:
        - Easy to operate on responsive packets of protocol
        - Allow to decode and transfer the packets. Further, it give match requests / respond to others
        - Support processes as scan, unit tests, attack detection, traceroute, and network monitor.
        - Provide better solution for existing problems (padding, decrypting, encapsulating, etc.)
- **Socket**
    - **How to install**: Enable the accessibility of the BSD socket interface
    - **Major Idea**:
        - Offer system call and library interface to work with socket function
        - Socket object act as the return value of socket() function
        - Executes on different system calls
        - Allow high-level metrics compare to other interfaces
        - Support automated buffer allocation where length is declared on send process
- **Impacket**
    - **Installation Command**: pip install impacket
    - **Advantages**:
        - Include python classes for performing network protocol related tasks
        - Packets are handled at low-level
        - Establish communication with window standards (NetBios, SMB, DCERPC and MSSQL)
        - For instance: Polenum, PorLa, CrackMapExec, Ranger, and more
- **Nmap**
    - **Installation Command**: pip install python-nmap
    - **Advantages**:
        - Suitable for system admin operations
        - Automate port scan process and analyze the outcome
        - Enable to run the customized attacks
- **Cryptography**
    - **Installation Command**: pip install cryptography
    - **Advantages**:
        - Incorporates high / low-level interfaces for processing cryptographic techniques.
        For instance: message digests and key derivation
        - Here, low-level is otherwise known as “hazmat” layer due to its risks which carries out in hazmat package
- **Requests**
    - **Installation Command**: pip install requests
    - **Advantages**:
        - It is an Apache2 HTTP library (Licensed) which enables user to communicate with the language. So, it doesn’t require URL query / POST data
        - Support automated HTTP request pool service
