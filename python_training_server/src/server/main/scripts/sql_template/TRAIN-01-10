Try to do a quick search on Google, or even better you can try to use Twitter, or Github. You can use querries like: <b>CVE-2024-3234 PoC</b>,
or <b>CVE-2024-3234 exploit</b> but keep in mind, you could encounter some challenges with encoding. Try to search how to url encode chars like one <b>.</b> or two <b>..</b> or <b>/</b> and also make requests with them encoded. Also, you could use results from popular github repository, like projectdiscovery's nuclei-templates. There you could search for your CVE number and try to read how they make the request, look for http tags, also you could look on web for other tags used in their templates. Keep in mind, you have to try harder every time.
